  "Delete failed `isearch' input, single char, or cancel search.

This is a modified variant of `isearch-abort' that allows us to
perform the following, based on the specifics of the case: (i)
delete the entirety of a non-matching part, when present; (ii)
delete a single character, when possible; (iii) exit current
search if no character is present and go back to point where the
search started."
