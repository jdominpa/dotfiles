* Setup

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # macOS
  bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/jdominpa/dotfiles/master/setup/setup.sh)"

  # Linux
  bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/jdominpa/dotfiles/master/setup/setup.sh)"
#+END_SRC

*NOTE*: in an arch linux system the setup script can be run in a tty.
Because of that, ~setup~ won't execute the ~update_content~ script which you will have to run after restarting the system.

** Running linux GUI programs with WSL and VcXsrv

Install [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/][VcXsrv]] and put this in ~.zshenv~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  export DISPLAY=$(ip route | awk '{print $3; exit}'):0
#+END_SRC
